          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">England-Wessex War</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Earlier this afternoon, a bloody struggle erupted across England as former <strong>King Evangelos</strong> launched 
            a campaign to reclaim Wessex from <strong>King Will</strong>, in a daring attempt to retake the English Throne. The 
            war started when King Will sailed to France, where King Evangelos and his forces were garrisoned, in an ambitious 
            assault meant to weaken Evangelos' forces.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Various reports from the scene state that King Will took down 7 out of the 10 men who were attempting to thwart 
            this attack. Once Will retreated back to England, Evangelos readied his forces, crossed the channel and rushed 
            towards London. Within minutes Evangelos' banners surrounded the capital.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The <strong>Siege of London</strong> proved brutal, with the city's ancient walls crumbling under relentless 
            bombardment. Despite being outnumbered, King Will refused to yield, personally leading his men in defense of the 
            breach. Witnesses claim the Wessex monarch fought fiercely, cutting down <strong>Fifteen of Evangelos' knights</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The outcome of this war is not entirely clear, however it seems to be a Wessex Victory. With Evangelos being sent 
            to the shadow realm by the Admins and Will retiring his position as King of Wessex. How long will this peace last?

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Quebec Independence</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In a stunning turn of events Quebec has broken away from The French Kingdom and formed its own Nation under 
            <strong>Kersoka</strong>. In a statement made by Kersoka on the 9th of October: "The French Kingdom has been 
            threatened by the UN and the Japanese and Manji's king has been nothing but silent. The Territory of New France 
            Thus being in danger of attack, wishes to separate and govern ourselves without input from Paris".
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            They also go on to state that "If the French Kingdom wants their territory back they will need to take it by 
            force". This leaves us the question, Will France strike to take back Quebec? We shall find out in the near future.
