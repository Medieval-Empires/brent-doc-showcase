          <p className="mb-4">
            The Embargo, set by the Byzantine Empire, on the Roman Empire has thankfully been Lifted. <strong>Mekanik</strong> stated 
            "The embargo lifted as of last night and both sides have agreed to apologise".
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This is great news for every citizen in the European Continent as a potential war has been averted and peace restored.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We at the Cymru Chronicle would also like to apologise to the Byzantine Empire, as in yesterday's issue we made 
            a mistake. We accidentally called Mekanik the Byzantine Emperor when actually the Emperor is <strong>Apr1c0rn</strong>.

            That's all the news for today folks, bit of a short one I know, been a bit of a slow day lol. When asked for new 
            news stories <strong>Vinnie</strong> declared "uhh everything is going good as far as I know". So I guess that 
            accurately sums it up.
